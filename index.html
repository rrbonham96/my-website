      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>
        Hi, I'm Alice. I've worked in primarily QA and DevOps roles for the last few years.
        I am primarily interested in working at companies with a SaaS and microservice
        infrastructure focus. In my day-to-day I primarily use Python, Bash, and Terraform for infrastructure and
        CI/CD automation, a. I enjoy working on complex problems that may not have a clear
        answer. I am neurodivergent, so I do prefer more direct conversations than social
        situations that rely on social cues I may not pick up on. I think about things
        differently, not less.
