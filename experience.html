      <h3>(Senior) DevOps Engineer - Trend Micro</h3>
      <h4>January 2022 - January 2025</h4>
      <p>
        While my title in this role was technically Senior DevOps Engineer,
        I don't feel like it accurately describes the role. Regardless,
        here are some of my accomplishments:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Designed and implemented an operations monitoring system for an AWS SaaS product using Terraform, Redshift, Kinesis Firehose, AWS Lambdas, Cloudwatch metrics and events, SNS, and Grafana to ensure the operations team could quickly respond to customer issues to ensure the 99.99% uptime SLA.
        </li>
        <li>
          Performed cloud cost optimizations of up to 20% by identifying key issues using AWS cost explorer to automate lifecycle rules for outdated EBS volumes and AMI images, as well as reducing networking costs by using services such as VPC gateway endpoints for VPC services accessing S3 and DynamoDB.
        </li>
        <li>
          Led migration of on-premise Jenkins deployment and testing pipelines to GitHub Actions, which greatly reduced maintenance costs and security concerns for DevOps, Quality Assurance, and IT departments.
        </li>
        <li>
          Implemented deployments of specialized testing infrastructure in AWS and Azure cloud environments using Terraform, ARM templates, and CloudFormation to minimize spin-up and teardown times for CI and CR testing as well as lowering cloud costs for idle cloud resources.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>QA Engineer - Trend Micro</h3>
      <h4>June 2021 - December 2021</h4>
      <p>
        This was my first job out of college. I moved up very quickly to a devops role
        because of my hard work on learning AWS and our in-house processes, and because of
        my frequent communication across departments. This role focused on Python test
        automation for Trend Micro's TippingPoint and Cloud One systems.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Wrote automated Behavior Driven Development (BDD) tests using Python to test microservices in a cloud environment, ensuring service reliability.
        </li>
        <li>
          Handled testing of REST APIs using manual tests in TestRail and Postman.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>QA Student Contractor - NetApp</h3>
      <h4>June 2018 - December 2020</h4>
      <p>
        As my primary internship/contract during university, I worked through a lot of growing
        pains here as a new developer. There was also quite a lot of server room and
        rack-and-stack work I had to do here (server and network setup). I worked primarily in
        a small team for NetApp's E-Series SAN devices focused on solutions engineering.
        Specifically "Cloud Connector" and a prototype container running on the SAN controller.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Built a containerized disk monitoring system using InfluxDB, Telegraf and Grafana to detect and prevent widespread hardware failures due to misconfiguration.
        </li>
        <li>
          Led API and hardware testing for a cloud-integrated video archiving solution for surveillance systems.
        </li>
        <li>
          Performed manual, UI, and API testing for an AWS S3-based storage backup solution.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Student Sustaining Engineer - Integra Technologies</h3>
      <h4>2017 - June 2018</h4>
      <p>
        This role was not particularly CS focused, but it did give me the opportunity to
        get used to working in an office environment. Essentially it was mostly about 
        data entry into Excel spreadsheets and troubleshooting electronic failures with 
        experienced test engineers, but I also had the opportunity to develop data processing 
        scripts using Perl.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Developed data processing scripts using Perl 5 to convert domain-specific log formats to Excel spreadsheets.
        </li>
      </ul>
