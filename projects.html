    <h2>Projects</h2>

    <p>Here are just a few of the projects I've worked on over the years.</p>

    <section>
      <h3>Senior Project - Wireless Stopwatch</h3>
      <p>
        The wireless stopwatch I worked on with my senior project team was intended
        to assist swimming coaches in timing young swimmers. According to our sponsor,
        the coaches always used a manual stopwatch as a backup for when the swimmers 
        did not have enough force to press the pressure plate in the pool when switching 
        back. The wireless part was to assist in noting down the times.
      </p>
      <p>
        The project itself included the stopwatch hardware, the embedded 
        software on it, and a receiver desktop application with a GUI to
        display and record times.
      </p>
      <p>
        I primarily worked on the wireless communication between the device and the
        desktop app. For the wireless transmission protocol we chose LoRa, which is 
        commonly used in IoT devices, because bluetooth did not give us the range
        capabilities that we needed. However, this decision brought some difficulty with it.
      </p>
      <p>
        LoRa is usually used with a protocol on top of it called LoRaWAN and a specialized 
        router-like device to handle TX/RX for a network of devices, but we did not have the 
        budget for one of these. Instead, I had to figure out the low-level details of the 
        LoRa protocol and radio communication in general in order for the devices to 
        communicate.
      </p>
      <p>
        I did eventually get it working with a LoRa USB dongle we tried out called a LoStik,
        but one unresolved issue we ran into was implementing multi-device support. For this
        we would have to develop CSMA/CA, but we simply did not have the time or resources 
        to do so.
      </p>
      <p>
        Overall the project was a great experience for learning about embedded software and 
        low-level radio communication that I would otherwise be oblivious to.

      <h3>Volunteering - Maize Elementary STEAM day</h3>
      <p>
        One of the requirements for graduating from a STEM degree at my university was 
        completing some volunteer work related to your field of study. For mine, I worked with 
        three other students to create an activity for a local elementary school's STEAM 
        (Science, Technology, Engineering, Art, Math) day that took place in their gym.
      </p>
      <p>
        One resource the school had access to was these little robot toys (Dash) that could be 
        programmed over bluetooth with an app based largely around the Scratch programming 
        language (Blockly). I had the opportunity to take one home and create a quick activity which 
        involved programming the robot to follow a known path on the ground and documenting it 
        for future teacher use.
      </p>
      <p>
        On the STEAM day it was very interesting to see how the different grade levels interacted 
        with the activity. For Kindergarten up to around second grade, we had to assist the students 
        with setting up and running the robots quite a bit. There was a lot of confusion about what 
        angles were for them. From third grade onwards, though, the students were very curious and 
        experimenting with what they could do with the robots.
      </p>
      <p>
        Overall it was a really great experience, and I got a chance to learn how technology can 
        interface with education.
